# Bank Marketing Classification Project

## a. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models on the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and financial attributes. The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment using Streamlit.

*(Add 1–2 sentences per model about strengths/weaknesses, e.g., “Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy but struggled with recall on minority class.”)*
